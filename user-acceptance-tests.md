# User Acceptance Tests for AI-Powered Prompt-Generating App

## Purpose
This document outlines the user acceptance test scenarios for our AI-powered prompt-generating application. These tests are designed to ensure that the application meets the requirements and expectations of end-users.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Prompt Generation
**Objective**: Verify that the application can generate a prompt based on a given topic.
- Enter a simple topic (e.g., "cats")
- Click the "Generate Prompt" button
- Verify that a relevant prompt is generated and displayed

### 2. Complex Topic Handling
**Objective**: Ensure the application can handle more complex or specific topics.
- Enter a more complex topic (e.g., "sustainable urban planning in developing countries")
- Generate a prompt
- Verify that the generated prompt is relevant and incorporates the complexity of the topic

### 3. Error Handling
**Objective**: Test the application's response to invalid inputs or errors.
- Try submitting an empty topic
- Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed
- Enter a very long topic (>100 characters)
- Verify that the input is either truncated or an error message is shown

### 4. UI Responsiveness
**Objective**: Ensure the UI is responsive and provides appropriate feedback.
- Click the "Generate Prompt" button
- Verify that the button changes to a "Generating..." state
- Confirm that the button is disabled during prompt generation
- Check that the generated prompt or error message appears in a timely manner

### 5. Multiple Consecutive Requests
**Objective**: Test the application's ability to handle multiple requests in succession.
- Generate a prompt for one topic
- Immediately after receiving the result, generate a prompt for a different topic
- Verify that both prompts are generated correctly and the UI updates appropriately

### 6. Prompt Quality and Relevance
**Objective**: Assess the quality and relevance of generated prompts.
- Generate prompts for a variety of topics (e.g., "science fiction writing", "healthy recipes", "digital marketing strategies")
- Evaluate each prompt for relevance to the topic, coherence, and usefulness

### 7. Cross-browser Compatibility
**Objective**: Ensure the application works consistently across different browsers.
- Test the application in multiple browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Verify that the UI renders correctly and all functionality works as expected in each browser

### 8. Mobile Responsiveness
**Objective**: Confirm that the application is usable on mobile devices.
- Access the application on various mobile devices or using mobile emulators
- Check that the UI adapts appropriately to different screen sizes
- Verify that all functionality, including prompt generation, works correctly on mobile

### 9. Accessibility
**Objective**: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
- Test keyboard navigation throughout the application
- Verify that all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA labels
- Check color contrast for text readability
- Ensure that error messages and notifications are announced by screen readers

### 10. Performance
**Objective**: Assess the application's performance under various conditions.
- Generate prompts in quick succession to test response times
- Check the application's behavior under poor network conditions (you can simulate this in browser dev tools)
- Verify that the application remains responsive even when generating longer or more complex prompts

## Reporting Issues
For each test scenario, document the following:
- Test result (Pass/Fail)
- Any unexpected behavior or errors encountered
- Screenshots or recordings of issues (if applicable)
- Steps to reproduce any failed tests

## Feedback
In addition to the specific test scenarios, collect general feedback on:
- Overall user experience
- Intuitiveness of the interface
- Quality and usefulness of generated prompts
- Any suggested improvements or additional features

This user acceptance testing will help ensure that our AI-powered prompt-generating app meets user expectations and functions correctly across various scenarios and environments.
